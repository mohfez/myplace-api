# myplace_api
Make API requests directly to MyPlace through a simple script and get detailed JSON responses.

## Overview
This repo consists of 2 Node.JS scripts, one for the MyPlace APIs `m_api.js` and the other for examples on how to use it `usage.js`.

`m_api.js` is a convenient wrapper  for accessing useful APIs from MyPlace. MyPlace is a platform that offers various services, and this script focuses on extracting and utilising the key functionalities through its APIs.

This comes in handy when you're unable to use the Strath app or if you're working on a small project.

## Quick Start
Set your username and password in `usage.js` then run the script using node:
```
node usage.js
```
